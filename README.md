# ICS Online Library (Subject to Revisions)
The Institute of Computer Science (ICS) Library System maintains a lot of materials such as Special Problems and thesis of BSCS/MSCS/PhD alumni, books and journals. These materials are used as a reference by current researchers and students. 

Currently, the only way to access them is through physically visiting the library. With the current pandemic situation and the need for social distancing, there is a need to offer such services online in a secured, efficient, and maintained manner, hence this proposed system.

This system is in partial fulfillment of the requirements for CMSC 128: Introduction to Software Engineering at the University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os.
